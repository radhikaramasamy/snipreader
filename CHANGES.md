# Changes Made: Replacing OpenAI with Gemini API

## Summary of Changes

We've completely replaced OpenAI with Google's Gemini API for all AI functionality in the application. The following changes were made:

1. **Removed OpenAI Dependency**
   - Removed the OpenAI client library dependency from `build.gradle`

2. **Removed OpenAI Configuration**
   - Removed OpenAI API configuration from `application.properties`

3. **Removed AIService**
   - Deleted the `AIService.java` file which was responsible for generating answers using OpenAI

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated README.md to remove all references to OpenAI
   - Simplified the API key configuration instructions

## Testing Instructions

To test the implementation:

1. **Configure Gemini API Key**
   - Get a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Add your API key to `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
     ```properties
     gemini.api.key=your-gemini-api-key-here
     ```

2. **Build and Run the Application**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

3. **Test the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Upload a screenshot containing MCQ questions
   - Verify that the questions are correctly extracted and answers are generated

## Verification

The application should work exactly as before, with Gemini API handling both:
1. Extracting questions from the uploaded image
2. Generating answers for the extracted questions

If you encounter any issues:
- Check the application logs for error messages
- Verify that your Gemini API key is correct and has the necessary permissions
- Ensure that the image format is supported (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Check that the image size is within the limits accepted by the Gemini API

## Benefits of the Change

- **Simplified Architecture**: Using a single AI provider for all functionality
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer external dependencies to manage
- **Consistent Results**: Using the same AI model for both question extraction and answer generation
- **Cost Efficiency**: Potentially lower costs by using a single API provider
