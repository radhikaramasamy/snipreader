# Tesseract OCR Dependency Removal

## Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove all Tesseract OCR-related dependencies from the project. The application had previously been migrated from using Tesseract OCR to Google's Gemini AI for image processing, but some Tesseract-related files and directories remained in the codebase.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed OCRService.java**
   - Deleted the OCRService class which contained Tesseract-specific code
   - This service was no longer being used as the application now uses GeminiService for image processing

2. **Removed tessdata directory**
   - Deleted the tessdata directory and its README.md file
   - This directory was previously used to store Tesseract language data files
   - These files are no longer needed as the application uses Gemini AI for text extraction

## Verification

- Confirmed that the MCQController only uses GeminiService, not OCRService
- Verified that there are no references to OCRService in the codebase
- Confirmed that there are no Tesseract-related configurations in application.properties
- Verified that the application builds successfully after removing these files

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed unused code and files, making the codebase easier to maintain
2. **Reduced Project Size**: Eliminated unnecessary files and potential confusion for new developers
3. **Simplified Setup**: New users no longer need to worry about Tesseract-related setup instructions
4. **Consistency**: The codebase now fully reflects the current architecture using Gemini AI

## Note

The IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md file contains historical references to the migration from Tesseract OCR to Gemini AI. This file was kept as is since it serves as valuable documentation of the application's evolution.
