# Unused Imports Analysis

## Summary

I've analyzed all Java files in the project to identify and remove unused imports as requested. After a thorough examination, I found that **no files contain unused imports**. The codebase is well-maintained in this regard, with all import statements being actively used in their respective files.

## Files Examined

1. **SnipreaderApplication.java**
   - All imports are used

2. **MCQController.java**
   - All imports are used

3. **ImageUploadForm.java**
   - All imports are used

4. **Question.java**
   - All imports are used

5. **GeminiService.java**
   - All imports are used

6. **OCRService.java**
   - All imports are used

7. **QuestionParserService.java**
   - All imports are used

8. **SnipreaderApplicationTests.java**
   - All imports are used

## Conclusion

The codebase is already optimized with respect to import statements. No changes were needed to satisfy the requirement to "remove unused imports".

This is a positive finding that indicates good code maintenance practices are being followed in the project.
